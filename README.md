# Python_Spark_Machine-Learning-With-Yelp
<br />
Synopsis: Analysis and machine learning across structured and unstructured Yelp.com data to answer questions about the data.
<br />
<br />
Motivation:  Real world data is messy and requires an ensemble of analysis and machine learning in order to fully understand big data.  In this case, we are looking at four Yelp datasets that document information about the businesses in its database, yelp users, business check-ins by users, and information about business reviews.  This analysis includes exploratory data analysis (Part 1), prediction using tree ensemble methods (Part 2), collaborative filtering for recommendation (Part 3), Word2Vector for text reviews (Part 4), and frequent pattern mining using FP-Growth algorithm (Part 5).  In the exploratory data analysis, particular focus is paid to analyzing the Power Law within this dataset.  Each part allows additional questions to be answered to fully understand the Yelp datasets.
